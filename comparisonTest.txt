1. where condition
A. Modify valuen of literal/string (>, <)
 sql_query1 = "SELECT  l_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority, sum((l_extendedprice) * (1-l_discount)) as revenue " \
            "FROM customer, orders, lineitem " \
            "WHERE customer.c_custkey = orders.o_orderkey " \
            "AND lineitem.l_orderkey = orders.o_orderkey " \
            "AND l_shipdate < '1995-03-15' " \
            "GROUP BY l_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority " \
            "ORDER BY revenue DESC, o_orderdate " \
            "LIMIT 20;"
sql_query2 = "SELECT l_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority, sum((l_extendedprice) * (1-l_discount)) as revenue " \

            "ORDER BY revenue DESC, o_orderdate " \
            "LIMIT 20;"

B. Addition/Removable OR condition, Addition of brackets

            "GROUP BY l_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority " \
            "ORDER BY revenue DESC, o_orderdate " \
            "LIMIT 20;"
sql_query2 = "SELECT  l_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority, sum((l_extendedprice) * (1-l_discount)) as revenue " \

            "WHERE customer.c_custkey = orders.o_orderkey " \
            "AND lineitem.l_orderkey = orders.o_orderkey " \
            "OR (l_shipdate = '11/12/2023' "\
            "AND RTT = 'apple'"\
            "AND RRR = 'apple')"\
            "GROUP BY l_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority " \
            "ORDER BY revenue DESC, o_orderdate " \
            "LIMIT 20;"

C. Addition of a new or removable of `and` codition in iterable/removed
